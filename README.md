<h1>Navigation Between Screans</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
This is a simple Android application built using Jetpack Compose to demonstrate navigation between multiple screens. The app showcases how to use the NavController and NavHost to navigate between three screens (ScreenA, ScreenB, and ScreenC). Each screen has a unique title and a button to navigate to the next screen.<br>

<h2>Features</h2>
- Navigation between screens: The app allows seamless navigation between three screens using Jetpack Compose's navigation components.<br>
- Dynamic screen titles: Each screen has a unique title that is passed as an argument during navigation.<br>
- Header with navigation icon: Each screen has a header (TopAppBar) with a navigation icon and an account icon.<br>
- Simple UI: The UI is minimalistic, with a centered text and a button to navigate to the next screen.<br>

<h2>Project Structure</h2>
- MainActivity.kt: The main entry point of the application. It sets up the NavController and defines the navigation graph.<br>
- ScreenA, ScreenB, ScreenC: These are the three screens that the user can navigate between. Each screen is a composable function that displays a title and a button to navigate to the next screen.<br>
- Header.kt: A reusable composable function that creates a TopAppBar with a title, navigation icon, and account icon.<br>
- myBtmBar.kt: A composable function that creates a bottom navigation bar.<br>
